## Dependencies

* Suitable datasets for PPE and construction component detection
* Cloud resources for deployment and testing
* Sample construction site images/videos for validation

---

## Potential Challenges

* Finding datasets that closely match real construction site conditions
* Handling different lighting conditions, camera angles, and crowded scenes
* Balancing model accuracy with the internship timeline
* Ensuring smooth integration between AI, backend, and dashboard components

---

## Our Approach

To reduce risk, we plan to start with a focused MVP and build incrementally. We will leverage pretrained YOLOv8 models, validate each module independently, and prioritize delivering a complete end-to-end working system before adding advanced features.

## Long-Term Vision

* Drone-Based Inspections
* CCTV Monitoring
* Edge AI Deployment
* Predictive Safety Analytics
* Multi-Site Monitoring Platform
* AI Safety Copilot for Construction Teams
